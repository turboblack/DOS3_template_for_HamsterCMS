# DOS3_template_for_HamsterCMS

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS world's smallest and very simple multi-template flatfile content management system 

this template is special in that it does not have any graphics, it is made exclusively of text symbols
Great for an old school project

To use a template, create an **dos3** folder in the **templates** folder, copy **index.html** there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like
