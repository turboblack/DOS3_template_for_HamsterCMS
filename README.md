# DOS3_template_for_HamsterCMS

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS world's smallest and very simple multi-template flatfile content management system 

this template is special in that it does not have any graphics, it is made exclusively of text symbols

HTML template made in the form of MS DOS programs

Great for an old school project

To use a template, create an **dos3** folder in the **templates** folder, copy **index.html** there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like

to change footer - edit footer.txt in the includes folder


I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS

works with both old and new technologies, and backward compatible

Enjoy your use.
